quantracker_air is an airborne unit for the quantracker that uses the FrSky telemetry system to send the position data back to the tracker.
The unit is based on an Arduino Pro Mini 5v 16 MHz unit
The Position data is acquired direct from a GPS unit attached to the airborne unit.
Currently only the Mediatek MTK3329 at 38400 baud is supported ( The unit that came with my Remzibi OSD)

Prerequisites
   applications
      avr-gcc version 4.7 or higher
      The Arduino programming enevironment
      avrdude - avr programmer

   The project requires the following libraries

   My quan physical quantities library - https://github.com/kwikius/quan-trunk
   
   The Arduino C/C++ source download http://arduino.cc/en/main/software

   Please note that though the project uses the Arduino source it doesnt use the Arduino environment since the project requires a newer version of gcc.
   The project also requires pre-existing external libraries which doesnt appear too be supported by the Arduino as far as I understand it.

   You can compile and build the project using gnu-make and the provided Makefile. You will need to hack the Makefile to change various directoroes and settings.
   See the Makefile for details.
   use "make upload" to upload to the board
